# CollaborativeProject
Collaboration for Novel Data Analysis between Kathryn Rhodes, Patrick Mireles, and Megan Hall for ADA 2025. 

This repo includes the raw data files (H&E histopathological stains of control and treated liver tissue sections), Quarto doc including the code and step-by-step instruction of the data analysis, and a Script describing the packages created for H&E stain quantification and statistical analysis. 

Project summary:
